### Twitter API

All Twitter access requires authentication

If our apps are hosted on GitHub - should not keep authentication data on public repo

therefore cannot use GH to keep scripts with authentication info

Google script supports curl (fetch )

Also could use curl in git shell
* maybe enter user name and pw at runtime


or lrean how to uses headers in xmlhttprequest!!!
