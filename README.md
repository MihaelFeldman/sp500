###### _Jaanga SP500 - Dev Revision - Code Edit View_ / [Open Full Screen]( https://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-html/templates/code-edit-view/code-edit-view-r2.html#https://jaanga.github.io/sp500/sp500-realtime/sp500-realtime-r3.html )


## Concept

_It's all very beta - including this documentation_

### Issues / Problems

Trying to gauge the movements of hundreds of stocks while they are trading is not easy.
It is quite difficult to note which are the outliers and which are in the middle of the pack.

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* View hundreds of market symbols in a non-reductionist manner
* Be able to get a picture of how the market is flowing

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* Help traders find interesting trading circumstances
* Spin-offs might tackle: financial markets, currencies, weather, Internet traffic


## Usage Notes

The first time you run the Jaanga SP500 script, you may need to refresh the page in order for everything to load properly.
The script only runs on devices that support [WebGL]( https://get.webgl.org/ ).

Once the script is running, updates will occur every minute or so - and you will see the symbols move just a bit,

**Navigation**
* Roll = left or 1 finger
* Zoom = scroll or 2 finger
* Move = right or 3 finger

**Desktop/laptop**
* Move your cursor over symbols to see their charts pop up. Click on empty area to clear.

**Tablet/phone**
* Not quite as easy as desktop. You may need to smudge or wiggle your finger in order to show the pop-up.
Click on an empty space to clear selection before clicking on another symbol

**Indicators**
During the trading day the symbols move across the table
* Left/Red - Right/Green. Symbols in the green area are gainers. Symbols in the red are losers.
The further the symbols are from the centerline the more they are gaining or losing.
Symbol stuck at the edges of the table have gained or lost over 20%
* Front/Start - Back/Finish. Movement from start to finish is based on volume - the current volume divided by the average daily volume.
All symbols start at zero. Symbols at the back have reached or exceeded 600% of the symbols average daily volume in that session
