* Add TooToo R6.1 as the file viewer
	* Add features to TooToo R6.2 and copied back to TooToo
* Add trades-replay-lines
	* Reads trades data and replays the day
	* Wonky, primitive presentation but it works in

Heads-up display now working on mobile devices - but UE could be better
No more iframes - loads nice and fast

Lots of fun to be back here. And lots of cool updates to R3.

* .toLocaleString() and .tolocaleTime( are nice new things
* Moving to a setTimeOut is also nice

Currently the script is using an iframe. It may not need to use one. Must investigate.

*Create two ground planes:
