## Concept

### Issues / Problems

Trying to gauge the movements of hundreds of stocks while they are trading is not easy.
It is quite difficult to not which are the outliers and which are in the middle of the pack.

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* View hundreds of market symbols in a non-reductionist manner
* Be able to get a picture of how the market is flowing


### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* Help traders find interesting trading circumstances
* Can tackle: financial markets, currencies, weather, Internet traffic

## Usage Notes

Navigation
* Roll = left or 1 finger
* Zoom = scroll or 2 finger
* Move = right or 3 finger

Desktop/laptop
* Move cursor over symbol to see its chart. Click on empty area to clear.

Tablet/phone
* Not quite as easy as desktop. You may need to smudge or wiggle your finger in order to show the heads-up. 
Click on an empty space to clear selection before clicking on another symbol

## Features
<!-- and benefits -->

* Displays the positions of the entire SP500
* Data is updated every minute or so
* Automatic acquisition and storage of data
* Full 3D ~ rotate, and and zoom in real-time
	* Real-time animation or real-time data   
* Heads-up display with links and charts for individual symbols
* Symbols colored by sector
* Data wrangling
	* Keep all the data visible always
* Large amounts of data
	* No server. No server management. Little that is hackable.
	* All data in the cloud
* Supports many data type possibilities
	* Augmented Unreality / heads-up display
* Storage likely to last until the end of time.
* A UI that is not a skeumorph of the meatworld/scond life
* UI that allows access to huge amounts of choices
	* non-reductionist ways or presenting data
* Run-time updates of data and/or code
* Single language - JavaScript - for the whole thing - no HTML or CSS
* Very CORS oriented
* Themable
* Code Customizable
* Many sorts of triage/representation/selection possibilities
* No crashes. It just works

* Display trails of the movements

## Issues /Bugs


## Project Links

Jaanga is a [GitHub]( http://github.com) [organization account]( https://help.github.com/articles/what-s-the-difference-between-user-and-organization-accounts ) and has multiple owners and admins. 
All Jaanga scripts are [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ).


## System Requirements

In order to run the script you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the script on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The script is currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
