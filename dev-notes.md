### Replay

### get trades r3

* getting google data looking good

## Realtime & Replay

Both settling down quite nicely



## 2017-03-20

Yahoo data is dirty / has incorrect values for volumes

Found simple fix: Google works if you don't change symbols to lower case.

Previously: many updates

R4 and R5

### 2015-10-30 ~ Theo

Heads-up display now working on mobile devices - but UE could be better
No more iframes - loads nice and fast


### 2015-10-29 ~ Theo

Lots of fun to be back here. And lots of cool updates to R3.

* .toLocaleString() and .tolocaleTime( are nice new things
* Moving to a setTimeOut is also nice

Currently the script is using an iframe. It may not need to use one. Must investigate.


### 2015-01-17 ~ Theo

### 2015-01-16 ~ Theo

All going well


*Create two ground planes:
	* one green, one red << done
	* with gradient textures
* Add gradient background << done
* Add average volume << done
* How to handle mouseover on mobile?
* Start adding labels << done / pullouts
* Wrangle the excessive volume << done and change percent outliers
* Consider how to store values for replay
* Create a spreadsheet with day's opening or day's high / low


### 2015-01-14 ~ Theo
